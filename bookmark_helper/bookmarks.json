        "description": "Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, \"powerful,\" \"strong\" and \"Paris\" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperform bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.",

        "description": "The growing carbon footprint of artificial intelligence (AI) models, especially large ones such as GPT-3, has been undergoing public scrutiny. Unfortunately, however, the equally important and enormous water (withdrawal and consumption) footprint of AI models has remained under the radar. For example, training GPT-3 in Microsoft's state-of-the-art U.S. data centers can directly evaporate 700,000 liters of clean freshwater, but such information has been kept a secret. More critically, the global AI demand may be accountable for 4.2 -- 6.6 billion cubic meters of water withdrawal in 2027, which is more than the total annual water withdrawal of 4 -- 6 Denmark or half of the United Kingdom. This is very concerning, as freshwater scarcity has become one of the most pressing challenges shared by all of us in the wake of the rapidly growing population, depleting water resources, and aging water infrastructures. To respond to the global water challenges, AI models can, and also must, take social responsibility and lead by example by addressing their own water footprint. In this paper, we provide a principled methodology to estimate the water footprint of AI models, and also discuss the unique spatial-temporal diversities of AI models' runtime water efficiency. Finally, we highlight the necessity of holistically addressing water footprint along with carbon footprint to enable truly sustainable AI.",

        "description": "Length generalization, the ability to generalize from small training context sizes to larger ones, is a critical challenge in the development of Transformer-based language models. Positional encoding (PE) has been identified as a major factor influencing length generalization, but the exact impact of different PE schemes on extrapolation in downstream tasks remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study comparing the length generalization performance of decoder-only Transformers with five different position encoding approaches including Absolute Position Embedding (APE), T5's Relative PE, ALiBi, and Rotary, in addition to Transformers without positional encoding (NoPE). Our evaluation encompasses a battery of reasoning and mathematical tasks. Our findings reveal that the most commonly used positional encoding methods, such as ALiBi, Rotary, and APE, are not well suited for length generalization in downstream tasks. More importantly, NoPE outperforms other explicit positional encoding methods while requiring no additional computation. We theoretically demonstrate that NoPE can represent both absolute and relative PEs, but when trained with SGD, it mostly resembles T5's relative PE attention patterns. Finally, we find that scratchpad is not always helpful to solve length generalization and its format highly impacts the model's performance. Overall, our work suggests that explicit position embeddings are not essential for decoder-only Transformers to generalize well to longer sequences.",

Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer – a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloud’s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So let’s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions. The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvard’s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter. 2020 Update: I’ve created a “Narrated Transformer” video which is a gentler approach to the topic: A High-Level Look Let’s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.",

It takes an input image and transforms it through a series of functions into class probabilities at the end. The transformed representations in this visualization can be loosely thought of as the activations of the neurons along the way. The parameters of this function are learned with backpropagation on a dataset of (image, label) pairs. This particular network is classifying CIFAR-10 images into one of 10 classes and was trained with ConvNetJS. Its exact architecture is [conv-relu-conv-relu-pool]x3-fc-softmax, for a total of 17 layers and 7000 parameters. It uses 3x3 convolutions and 2x"

Brügmann）首次将其应用于对弈程序[4]，但他的想法未获得重视。2006年堪称围棋领域蒙特卡洛革命的一年[5]，雷米·库洛姆（Remi Coulom）描述了蒙特卡洛方法在游戏树搜索的应用并命名为蒙特卡洛树搜索[6]。列文特·科奇什（Levente Kocsis）和乔鲍·塞派什瓦里（Csaba Szepesvári）开发了UCT算法[7]，西尔万·热利（Sylvain Gelly）等人在他们的程序MoGo中实现了UCT[8]。2008年，MoG"

Raft is a consensus algorithm that is designed to be easy to understand. It's equivalent to Paxos in fault-tolerance and performance. The difference is that it's decomposed into relatively independent subproblems, and it cleanly addresses all major pieces needed for practical systems. We hope Raft will make consensus available to a wider audience, and that this wider audience will be able to develop a variety of higher quality consensus-based systems than are available today. Hold on—what is consensus? Consensus is a fundamental problem in fault-tolerant distributed systems. Consensus involves multiple servers agreeing on values. Once they reach a decision on a value, that decision is final. Typical consensus algorithms make progress when any majority of their servers is available; for example, a cluster of 5 servers can continue to operate even if 2 se"

The most direct way is to embed SIMD assembly in your code, which is apparently cumbersome and error-prone. You can also let the compiler automatically optimize your code with SIMD by using openMP (we will cover openMP later in this course). For example:Copy#pragma omp simd for(i=0;i<N;i++) { C[i] = A[i] + B[i]; }However, the code patterns that can be automatically detected and optimized by Compiler are limited. SIMD intrinsics are convenient if you want to manually optimize your code using SIMD without touching assembly. It is basically a library that wraps SIMD assembly as C functions. Let's re-write our vector addition example by SIMD intrinsics.add_simd.cCopy#include <xmmintrin.h> //header file for sse #include <stdio.h>"

As an analogy, Go+gRPC is kind of like writing assembly, where actor programming is kind of like Object-Oriented programming for distributed environments.You can think of Actor is Class in OO programming.

Hello, world! true. 上面命令输出 Hello world。 有几个地方需要注意。Prolog 所有语句的结尾都用一个\"点\"（.）表示结束。write()是打印命令。命令本身就是一个表达式，输出完成以后，返回值就是true.，也会显示出来。 如果想在 Hello world 之间插入一个换行，可以使用nl命令。 ?- write('Hello,'), nl, write('world'). Hello, world true. 退出 SWI-Prolog，可以使用halt命令，别忘了后面还要加一个点。 ?- halt. 二、基本语法 2.1 常量和变量 Prolog 的变量和常量规则很简单：小写字母开头的字符串，就是常量；大写字母开头的字符串，就是变量。 ?- write(abc). abc true. ?- write(Abc). _3386 true. 上面代码中，abc是常量，输出就是自身"

Another integral part of computer vision is object detection. Object detection aids in pose estimation, vehicle detection, surveillance etc. The difference between object detection algorithms and classification algorithms is that in detection algorithms, we try to draw a bounding box around the object of interest to locate it within the image. Also, you might not necessarily draw just one bounding box in an object detection case, there could be many bounding box"

Mix3D is a data augmentation technique for segmenting large-scale 3D scenes. Since scene context helps reasoning about object semantics, current works focus on models with large capacity and receptive fields that can fully capture the global context of an input 3D scene. However, strong contextual priors can have detrimental implications like mistaking a pedestrian crossing the street for a car. In this work, we focus on the importance of balancing global scene context and local geometry, with the goal of generalizing beyond the contextual priors in the training set. In particular, we propose a \"mixing\" technique which creates new training samp"

Today we are going to develop a peer-to-peer chat application using react-native leveraging the power of WebRTC. The inspiration for this article comes from the research during my pre-GSoC journey for AOSSIE organization where we are working on developing a similar application.Now, let's first try to understand the core concepts from a high level, and then we will dig deep into the code. So, what the heck is WebRTC? WebRTC stands for Web Real-time communication.

The first deploy worked fine and you were able to try the function. When attempting to deploy an update of the function, no changes are deployed. The output of the cdk diff command says “There were no differences”.When using the aws-cdk Lambda docs and examples, the code for the Lambda function is fetched by lambda.Code.fromAsset() This is from a local directory within the cdk project and works as expected because the cdk is able to calculate a hash of the files to detect a change in the code.My GitHub Actions workflow was pushing zip files to S3 containing the code for the Lambda functions. This meant that I use lambda.Code.fromBucket.Something like this: // bucket is of type Bucket construct from aws-cdk/aws-s3 package. // This is path of the release zip file in s3. const release"

For most applications, a single table is all you need. However, for time series data, you can often best handle it by using one table per application per period. Design pattern for time series data Consider a typical time series scenario, where you want to track a high volume of events. Your write access pattern is that all the events being recorded have today's date. Your read access pattern might be to read today's events most frequently, yesterday's events much less frequently, and then older events very little at all.

        "description": "Augmented reality (AR) enables an interactive experience with the real world where real-world objects are enhanced with computer-generated perceptual information. Twenty-five years have passed since the first AR application designed exclusively to be used in educational settings. Since then, this technology has been successfully implemented to enrich educational contexts providing learning gains, motivation, enjoyment, autonomy, among other benefits. This study provides an overview of AR technology in education from its origins to the present. Consequently, based on the analysis of its evolution, the study defines three generations of AR in education.

        "description": "Head-mounted displays (HMDs) have the potential to greatly impact the surgical field by maintaining sterile conditions in healthcare environments. Google Glass (GG) and Microsoft HoloLens (MH) are examples of optical HMDs. In this comparative survey related to wearable augmented reality (AR) technology in the medical field, we examine the current developments in wearable AR technology, as well as the medical aspects, with a specific emphasis on smart glasses and HoloLens. The authors searched recent articles (between 2017 and 2022) in the PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and ScienceDirect databases and a total of 37 relevant studies were considered for this analysis. The selected studies were divided into two main groups; 15 of the studies (around 41%) focused on smart glasses (e.g., Google Glass) and 22 (59%) focused on Microsoft HoloLens. Google Glass was used in various surgical specialities and preoperative settings, namely dermatology visits and nursing skill training. Moreover, Microsoft HoloLens was used in telepresence applications and holographic navigation of shoulder and gait impairment rehabilitation, among others. However, some limitations were associated with their use, such as low battery life, limited memory size, and possible ocular pain. Promising results were obtained by different studies regarding the feasibility, usability, and acceptability of using both Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens in patient-centric settings as well as medical education and training. Further work and development of rigorous research designs are required to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of wearable AR devices in the future.",

        "title": "JMIR mHealth and uHealth - Using Google Glass in Surgical Settings: Systematic Review",
        "description": "Background: In recent years, wearable devices have become increasingly attractive and the health care industry has been especially drawn to Google Glass because of its ability to serve as a head-mounted wearable device. The use of Google Glass in surgical settings is of particular interest due to the hands-free device potential to streamline workflow and maintain sterile conditions in an operating room environment. Objective: The aim is to conduct a systematic evaluation of the literature on the feasibility and acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings and to assess the potential benefits and limitations of its application. Methods: The literature was searched for articles published between January 2013 and May 2017. The search included the following databases: PubMed MEDLINE, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, PsycINFO (EBSCO), and IEEE Xplore. Two reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts and assessed full-text articles. Original research articles that evaluated the feasibility, usability, or acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings were included. This review was completed following the Preferred Reporting Results of Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: Of the 520 records obtained, 31 met all predefined criteria and were included in this review. Google Glass was used in various surgical specialties. Most studies were in the United States (23/31, 74%) and all were conducted in hospital settings: 29 in adult hospitals (29/31, 94%) and two in children’s hospitals (2/31, 7%). Sample sizes of participants who wore Google Glass ranged from 1 to 40. Of the 31 studies, 25 (81%) were conducted under real-time conditions or actual clinical care settings, whereas the other six (19%) were conducted under simulated environment. Twenty-six studies were pilot or feasibility studies (84%), three were case studies (10%), and two were randomized controlled trials (6%). The majority of studies examined the potential use of Google Glass as an intraoperative intervention (27/31, 87%), whereas others observed its potential use in preoperative (4/31, 13%) and postoperative settings (5/31, 16%). Google Glass was utilized as a videography and photography device (21/31, 68%), a vital sign monitor (6/31, 19%), a surgical navigation display (5/31, 16%), and as a videoconferencing tool to communicate with remote surgeons intraoperatively (5/31, 16%). Most studies reported moderate or high acceptability of using Google Glass in surgical settings. The main reported limitations of using Google Glass utilization were short battery life (8/31, 26%) and difficulty with hands-free features (5/31, 16%). Conclusions: There are promising feasibility and usability data of using Google Glass in surgical settings with particular benefits for surgical education and training. Despite existing technical limitations, Google Glass was generally well received and several studies in surgical settings acknowledged its potential for training, consultation, patient monitoring, and audiovisual recording.",

There are a host of NLP applications that are commonly used in our everyday lives: machine translation (e.g. Google Translate) and chatbot (e.g. Siri) are two examples. A common theme of my research is that it involves building computational models in an unsupervised or semi-supervised setting, i.e. a learning scenario where the supervision signal for model training is not available or scarce. My research is generally guided by a diverse flavour of applications, e.g. topic models, lexical semantics, text generation and misinformation detection. Prior to joining the University of Melbourne, I spent over 3.5 years as an industry scientist at IBM Research, developing solutions for clients in application domains from education to government. Parallel to this, I was active in research and collaborated with universities around the world, and in recognition of my scientific achievements I was awarded a research accomplishment prize by IBM in 2019.",

PCA人脸识别操作流程     在平时的研究中，我总结的PCA人脸识别的主要流程如下图所示：                                                                                      图 1 PCA人脸识别流程图       通过上图的PCA人脸识别流程可以看出，PCA方法可以总结为以下几个阶段：训练样本、特征提取、构造特征空间、投影计算。 2.

        "description": "Using a combinations of traditional distance measures in Eigenspace to improve performance in the matching stage of face recognition and comparing variations in performance due to different distance measures and numbers of Eigenvectors is compared. This study examines the role of Eigenvector selection and Eigenspace distance measures on PCA-based face recognition systems. In particular, it builds on earlier results from the FERET face recognition evaluation studies, which created a large face database (1,196 subjects) and a baseline face recognition system for comparative evaluations. This study looks at using a combinations of traditional distance measures (City-block, Euclidean, Angle, Mahalanobis) in Eigenspace to improve performance in the matching stage of face recognition. A statistically significant improvement is observed for the Mahalanobis distance alone when compared to the other three alone. However, no combinations of these measures appear to perform better than Mahalanobis alone. This study also examines questions of how many Eigenvectors to select and according to what ordering criterion. It compares variations in performance due to different distance measures and numbers of Eigenvectors. Ordering Eigenvectors according to a like-image difference value rather than their Eigenvalues is also considered.",

WifiDisplay简介 Wi-Fi Display经常和Miracast联系在一起。实际上，Miracast是Wi-Fi联盟（Wi-Fi Alliance）对支持Wi-Fi Display功能的设备的认证名称。通过Miracast认证的设备将在最大程度内保持对Wi-Fi Display功能的支持和兼容。 Miracast的Android实现涉及到系统的多个模块，包括： MediaPlayerService及相关模块：原因很明显，因为Miracast本身就牵扯到RTP/RTSP及相应的编解码技术。 SurfaceFlinger及相关模块：SurfaceFlinger的作用是将各层UI数据混屏并投递到显示设备中去显示。现在，SurfaceFlinger将支持多个显示设备。而支持Miracast的远端设备也做为一个独立的显示设备存在于系统中。 WindowManagerService及相关模块：WindowManagerService用于管理系统中各个UI层的位置和属性。由于并非所有的UI层都会通过Mirac"

RNN模型训练 有了特征，"
